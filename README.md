**Abstract:** Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the most common index for welfare, merely measures the size of the market economy. Recent efforts to better measure welfare aggregate a series of welfare-related dimensions, including economic, social, and environmental. Though these new indices expand welfare dimensions, they focus only on the magnitude of welfare. Sustainable welfare requires a balanced structure of these welfare dimensions, which is not reflected in these indices. This paper highlights the significance of the diversity of welfare dimensions. We propose a framework for integrating the diversity information into existing welfare indices, in a way that is applicable to most indices. This framework produces a new index named Sustainable Welfare Index (SWI) that combines the magnitude and the diversity information. We apply the framework to the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) and evaluate the SWI that is based on GPI for China’s 31 provinces from 1985 to 2018, and 286 prefecture-level cities from 2006 to 2018. Results show an unbalanced structure of welfare of China, and as a result, the decoupling between sustainable welfare and economic growth is more severe than originally thought. The decoupling trend can be explained by the heterogenous effects of population scale and industrial structure – the marginal benefit from the expansion of population or the growth of a sector is diminishing. The SWI can help guide the promotion of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) because of their common focus on balanced development.
