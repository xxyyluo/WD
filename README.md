**Abstract:** Traditional metrics of development like GDP only measure the market economy’s size. While many recent efforts acknowledge the combined economic, social, and environmental dimensions of development, they still focus on aggregate magnitude. We emphasize the importance of a balanced development structure and create a framework to embed information about this balance into current indices. Applying this framework to China, we assess its provinces’ and prefectures’ sustainable development from 1985 to 2018. Our findings reveal China’s imbalanced development structure, resulting in a decoupling between economic growth and sustainable development. The framework supports the advancement of the Sustainable Development Goals because of their shared emphasis on balanced development.
