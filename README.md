**Abstract:** Most previous efforts to measure human welfare aggregate a series of welfare-related dimensions, including economic, social, and environmental welfare. However, these efforts focus only on the magnitude of welfare. This paper highlights the significance of the “diversity” of welfare sources in estimating human welfare. We propose a new welfare index, Sustainable Welfare (SW), that integrates the Welfare Diversity (WD) and Welfare Magnitude (W). The new index implies that the increase in one welfare source enhances the SW, but its marginal effect would be diminishing when the welfare source already dominates. Both welfare magnitude and diversity are crucial. This framework can be applied to most welfare index. We apply the framework to the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) for China’s 31 provinces over the period from 1985 to 2018, and 235 prefectures from 2007 to 2018. When applying to GPI, SW corresponds to Sustainable GPI (SGPI) that is a new index based on GPI but incorporating WD information. China’s WD has declined during the past 30 years, and as a result, there was an increasing decoupling trend between GPI and SGPI. The decoupling trend can be explained by three mechanisms – scale, structure, and technology. We also find the heterogenous effects of different stages of the scale and structure factors on the decoupling phenomenon. Welfare indicators with diversity information can guide China and the world to balance welfare structure when approaching the limit on the scale that is defined as “planetary boundaries”.
