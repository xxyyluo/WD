**Abstract:** Most previous efforts to measure human welfare aggregate a series of welfare-related dimensions, including economic, social, and environmental indicators. However, these efforts focus only on welfare magnitude. This paper highlights the significance of the “diversity” of welfare index dimensions in estimating human welfare. We propose a new welfare index that integrates the Shannon-Wiener diversity of the welfare index dimensions (*WD*) and the welfare index magnitude. This framework can be applied to any welfare index. Here we apply the framework to the Genuine Progress Indicator (*GPI*) for China’s 31 provinces over the period from 1985 to 2018. We create a Sustainable *GPI* (*SGPI*) as the product of *WD* and *GPI* magnitude.  Results for China as a whole show an increasing separation between *GDP*/capita and *GPI*/capita. Declining *WD* implies that *SGPI* is separating even further. Results by province show large but declining differences in all three indicators, which can be mainly explained by industrial structure, population density, and technological progress. Better indicators of sustainable welfare can help China and the world achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and create the ecological civilization we desperately need.
